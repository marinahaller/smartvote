This package was created for the Master module "R Programming" at the University of Zurich. 
It's purpose is to automize repetitive tasks that fall upon the team at the Swiss Voting Advice Application (VAA) "smartvote".

So far, there is only one function included in the package: "stats_sociodem()" allows users to calculate common descriptive statistics for parliamentary candidates (e.g. gender distribution within the candidates, overall and per party) in one line of code.
In the future, other functions should be added for other repetitive tasks, such as cleaning the datasets.
